 *      Condition variables
 *
 * A condition variable is a method of waiting until a certain condition
 * becomes true.  Conventionally, a condition variable supports three
 * operations: (1) sleep; (2) signal, which wakes up one process sleeping
 * on the condition variable; and (3) broadcast, which wakes up every
 * process sleeping on the condition variable.  In our implementation,
 * condition variables put a process into an interruptible sleep (so it
 * can be cancelled prior to the fulfillment of the condition) and do not
 * use pointers internally (so that they are safe to use within DSMs).
