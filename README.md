# OpenTenBase Database Management System
OpenTenBase is an advanced enterprise-level database management system based on prior work of Postgres-XL project. It supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including transactions, foreign keys, user-defined types and functions. Additional, it adds parallel computing, security, management, audit and other functions.

OpenTenBase has many language interfaces similar to PostgreSQL, many of which are listed here:

	https://www.postgresql.org/download

## Overview
A OpenTenBase cluster consists of multiple CoordinateNodes, DataNodes, and GTM nodes. All user data resides in the DataNode, the CoordinateNode contains only metadata, the GTM for global transaction management. The CoordinateNodes and DataNodes share the same schema.

Users always connect to the CoordinateNodes, which divides up the query into fragments that are executed in the DataNodes, and collects the results.

## Building OpenTenBase

### System Requirements

- **Memory:** At least 4GB of RAM to ensure smooth operation.
- **Operating System:** Compatible with TencentOS 2, TencentOS 3, OpenCloudOS, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, and Ubuntu for a wide range of deployment options.

### Dependencies Installation

To prepare your system for building OpenTenBase, you'll need to install some essential development libraries. Use the package manager specific to your OS to install the required dependencies:

For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., CentOS):

```shell
yum -y install gcc make readline-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel uuid-devel bison flex
```

For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):

```shell
apt install -y gcc make libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libossp-uuid-dev bison flex
```

### Setting Up the 'opentenbase' User

Creating a dedicated user account for OpenTenBase is a best practice for security and management. Follow these steps to set up the user and its home directory:

```shell
mkdir /data
useradd -d /data/opentenbase -s /bin/bash -m opentenbase # Creates the 'opentenbase' user with a home directory at /data/opentenbase
passwd opentenbase # Prompts you to set a password for the new user
```

### Compilation and Installation

Now that your system is ready, you can proceed with the actual building process of OpenTenBase:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OpenTenBase/OpenTenBase
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   ```shell
   export SOURCECODE_PATH=/data/opentenbase/OpenTenBase
   export INSTALL_PATH=/data/opentenbase/install
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Source Code Directory and Begin the Build:**

   ```shell
   cd ${SOURCECODE_PATH}
   rm -rf ${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v2.0 # Removes previous build artifacts if present
   chmod +x configure* # Makes the configure scripts executable
   
   # Run the configuration script with the specified installation prefix and options
   ./configure --prefix=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v2.0 --enable-user-switch --with-openssl --with-ossp-uuid CFLAGS=-g
   
   # Clean previous builds and prepare for a fresh one
   make clean
   
   # Compile the source code using all available CPU cores for a faster build
   make -sj
   
   # Install the compiled software to the designated location
   make install
   
   # Ensure the necessary executables have the proper permissions
   chmod +x contrib/pgxc_ctl/make_signature
   
   # Navigate into the contrib directory to compile and install additional components
   cd contrib
   make -sj
   make install
   ```

**Troubleshooting Note for Ubuntu Users:** If you encounter the "initgtm: command not found" error during the "init all" step, it may be due to the system not recognizing the path to the 'initgtm' executable. To resolve this, you can add the installation's 'bin' directory to your system's PATH environment variable by editing the `/etc/environment` file and appending the following line:

```
${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v2.0/bin
```

This will ensure that the 'initgtm' command and other executables from the OpenTenBase installation are accessible system-wide. Don't forget to reload your environment or restart your session for the changes to take effect.

## Installation
Use PGXC\_CTL tool to build a cluster, for example: a cluster with a global transaction management node (GTM), a coordinator(COORDINATOR) and two data nodes (DATANODE).

### Preparation

1. Install pgxc and import the path of pgxc installation package into environment variable.

    ```shell
	PG_HOME=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v2.0
	export PATH="$PATH:$PG_HOME/bin"
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PG_HOME/lib"
	export LC_ALL=C
    ```

2. Disable SELinux and firewall (optional)

    ```
	vi /etc/selinux/config # set SELINUX=disabled
	# Disable firewalld
    systemctl disable firewalld
    systemctl stop firewalld
    ```
    
2. Get through the SSH password free login between the machines where the cluster node is installed, and then deploy and init will SSH to the machines of each node. After getting through, you do not need to enter the password.

    ```
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub destination-user@destination-server
    ```

### Cluster startup steps

1. Generate and fill in configuration file pgxc\_ctl.conf. pgxc\_ctl tool can generate a template for the configuration file. You need to fill in the cluster node information in the template. After the pgxc\_ctl tool is started, pgxc\_ctl directory will be generated in the current user's home directory. After entering " prepare config" command, the configuration file template that can be directly modified will be generated in pgxc\_ctl directory.

	* The pgxcInstallDir at the beginning of the configuration file refers to the installation package location of pgxc. The database user can set it according to his own needs.

	```
	pgxcInstallDir=${INSTALL_PATH}/opentenbase_bin_v2.0
	```

	* For GTM, you need to configure the node name, IP, port and node directory.

	```
	#---- GTM ----------
	gtmName=gtm
	gtmMasterServer=xxx.xxx.xxx.1
	gtmMasterPort=50001
	gtmMasterDir=${GTM_MASTER_DATA_DIR}/data/gtm_master
	```

	* If you do not need gtmSlave, you can directly set it to 'n' in the configuration of the corresponding node.

	```
	gtmSlave=n
	```

	If you need gtmSlave, configure it according to the instructions in the configuration file.

	* Coordination node, which needs to be configured with IP, port, directory, etc.

	```
	coordNames=(cn001)
	coordMasterCluster=(opentenbase_cluster)
	coordPorts=(30004)
	poolerPorts=(30014)
	coordPgHbaEntries=(0.0.0.0/0)
	coordMasterServers=(xxx.xxx.xxx.2)
	coordMasterDirs=(${COORD_MASTER_DATA_DIR}/data/cn_master/cn001)
	```

	* Data node, similar to the above nodes: IP, port, directory, etc. (since there are two data nodes, you need to configure the same information as the number of nodes.)

	```
	primaryDatanode=dn001
	datanodeNames=(dn001 dn002)
	datanodePorts=(20008 20009)
	datanodePoolerPorts=(20018 20019)
	datanodeMasterCluster=(opentenbase_cluster opentenbase_cluster)
	datanodePgHbaEntries=(0.0.0.0/0)
	datanodeMasterServers=(xxx.xxx.xxx.3 xxx.xxx.xxx.4)
	datanodeMasterDirs=(${DATANODE_MASTER_DATA_DIR}/data/dn_master/dn001 ${DATANODE_MASTER_DATA_DIR}/data/dn_master/dn002)
	```

	There are coordSlave and datanodeSlave corresponding to the coordination node and data node. If not, configure them as 'n'; otherwise, configure them according to the configuration file.

	In addition, two type ports: `poolerPort` and `port`, need to be configured for coordinator node and datanode. `poolerPort` is used by nodes to communicate with other nodes. `port` is the port used to login to the node. Here, `poolerPort` and `port` must be configured differently, otherwise there will be conflicts and the cluster cannot be started.

	Each node needs to have its own directory and cannot be created in the same directory.

2. Distribution of installation package(deploy all). After filling in the configuration file, run the pgxc\_ctl toolï¼Œand then input "deploy all" command to distribute the installation package to the IP machine of each node.
![topology](images/deploy.png)

3. Initialize each node of the cluster(init all). After the distribution of the installation package is completed, input "init all" command in pgxc\_ctl tool to initialize all the nodes in the configuration file pgxc\_ctl.conf and start the cluster. So far, the cluster has been started.

## Usage

```
$ psql -h ${CoordinateNode_IP} -p ${CoordinateNode_PORT} -U ${pgxcOwner} -d postgres

postgres=# create default node group default_group  with (dn001,dn002);
CREATE NODE GROUP
postgres=# create sharding group to group default_group;
CREATE SHARDING GROUP
postgres=# create table foo(id bigint, str text) distribute by shard(id);
