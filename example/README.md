# Examples for Opentenbase

In this directory, we have listed some application examples developed and deployed based on OpenTenbase.


## Build Cluster(1C2D) using docker

In this example, we try to build a cluster which includes 1 Coordinator Node and 2 Data Node using docker techniques. We aim to provide users with a basic example of building a distributed cluster using Docker for OpenTenbase. This will facilitate quick deployment for users and allow for further customization and development.

Dir for this example : ./1c_2d_cluster/
