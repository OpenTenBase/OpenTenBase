# By convention, we put no more than twenty tests in any one parallel group;
# this limits the number of connections needed to run the tests.
# ----------

# run oracle compatibility and audit
test: oracle audit

# test for interval partition 
test: partition
test: partition_index

# test for partition by schema which can be compatible of oracle's
test: partition_range
test: partition_list

#run alter node
test: alter_node

# run tablespace by itself, and first, because it forces a checkpoint;
# we'd prefer not to have checkpoints later in the tests because that
# interferes with crash-recovery testing.
test: tablespace

# ----------
# The first group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: boolean char name varchar text int2 int4 int8 oid float4 float8 bit numeric txid uuid enum money rangetypes pg_lsn regproc zhcn_utf8

# Depends on things setup during char, varchar and text
test: strings zhcn_gb18030
# Depends on int2, int4, int8, float4, float8
test: numerology

# ----------
# The second group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: point lseg line box path polygon circle date time timetz timestamp timestamptz interval abstime reltime tinterval inet macaddr macaddr8 tstypes

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# geometry depends on point, lseg, box, path, polygon and circle
# horology depends on interval, timetz, timestamp, timestamptz, reltime and abstime
# ----------
test: geometry horology regex oidjoins type_sanity opr_sanity misc_sanity comments expressions

# ----------
# These four each depend on the previous one
# ----------
test: insert
test: insert_conflict
test: create_function_1
test: create_type
test: create_table
test: create_function_2

# ----------
# Load huge amounts of data
# We should split the data files into single files and then
# execute two copy tests parallel, to check that copy itself
# is concurrent safe.
# ----------
test: copy copyselect copydml

# ----------
# More groups of parallel tests
# ----------
test: create_misc create_operator
# These depend on the above two
test: create_index create_view

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: create_aggregate create_function_3 create_cast constraints triggers inherit create_table_like typed_table vacuum drop_if_exists updatable_views rolenames roleattributes create_am hash_func

# ----------
# sanity_check does a vacuum, affecting the sort order of SELECT *
# results. So it should not run parallel to other tests.
# ----------
test: sanity_check

# ----------
# Believe it or not, select creates a table, subsequent
# tests need.
# ----------
test: errors
test: select
ignore: random

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: select_into select_distinct select_distinct_on select_implicit select_having subselect union case join aggregates transactions random portals arrays btree_index hash_index update namespace delete

# prepared_xacts cannot run in parallel of other tests involving 2PC
test: prepared_xacts

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: alter_generic alter_operator misc psql async dbsize misc_functions sysviews tsrf tidscan stats_ext fast_default

# rules cannot run concurrently with any test that creates a view
test: rules psql_crosstab amutils

# run by itself so it can run parallel workers
test: select_parallel

# no relation related tests can be put in this group
test: publication subscription

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: select_views portals_p2 foreign_key cluster dependency guc bitmapops combocid tsearch tsdicts foreign_data window xmlmap functional_deps json jsonb json_encoding indirect_toast equivclass

# ----------
# As XL uses advisory locks internally running this test separately.
# ----------
test: advisory_lock
#Separate out as similar table foo is created in others below.
test: rangefuncs
# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# NB: temp.sql does a reconnect which transiently uses 2 connections,
# so keep this parallel group to at most 19 tests
# ----------
test: plancache limit plpgsql copy2 temp domain prepare without_oid conversion truncate alter_table sequence polymorphism rowtypes returning xml

# ----------
# Another group of parallel tests
# ----------
test: identity partition_join partition_prune partition_prune_hash hash_part partition_info indexing

# event triggers cannot run concurrently with any test that runs DDL
test: event_trigger

# run stats by itself because its delay may be insufficient under heavy load
test: stats

# ----------
# Postgres-XC additional tests
# ----------
# This creates functions used by tests xc_misc, xc_FQS and xc_FQS_join
test: xc_create_function
# Those ones can be run in parallel
test: xc_groupby xc_distkey xc_having xc_temp xc_remote xc_FQS xc_FQS_join xc_copy xc_for_update xc_alter_table xc_sequence xc_misc

# Cluster setting related test is independant
test: xc_node

# Additional tests for prepared xacts
test: xc_prepared_xacts

# This runs statements that are not allowed in a transaction block
test: xc_notrans_block

# This runs XL specific tests
test: xl_primary_key xl_foreign_key xl_distribution_column_types xl_alter_table xl_distribution_column_types_modulo xl_plan_pushdown xl_functions xl_limitations xl_user_defined_functions xl_join xl_distributed_xact xl_create_table
