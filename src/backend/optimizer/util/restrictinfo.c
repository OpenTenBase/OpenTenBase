 *		relids (parameterization's outer relations)
 *
 * The API would be a bit clearer if we passed the current relids and the
 * outer relids separately and did bms_union internally; but since most
 * callers need to apply this function to multiple clauses, we make the
 * caller perform the union.
 *
 * Obviously, the clause must only refer to Vars available from the current
 * relation plus the outer rels.  We also check that it does reference at
 * least one current Var, ensuring that the clause will be pushed down to
 * a unique place in a parameterized join tree.  And we check that we're
 * not pushing the clause into its outer-join outer side, nor down into
 * a lower outer join's inner side.
 *
 * The check about pushing a clause down into a lower outer join's inner side
 * is only approximate; it sometimes returns "false" when actually it would
 * be safe to use the clause here because we're still above the outer join
 * in question.  This is okay as long as the answers at different join levels
 * are consistent: it just means we might sometimes fail to push a clause as
 * far down as it could safely be pushed.  It's unclear whether it would be
 * worthwhile to do this more precisely.  (But if it's ever fixed to be
 * exactly accurate, there's an Assert in get_joinrel_parampathinfo() that
 * should be re-enabled.)
 *
 * There's no check here equivalent to join_clause_is_movable_to's test on
 * lateral_referencers.  We assume the caller wouldn't be inquiring unless
 * it'd verified that the proposed outer rels don't have lateral references
 * to the current rel(s).  (If we are considering join paths with the outer
 * rels on the outside and the current rels on the inside, then this should
 * have been checked at the outset of such consideration; see join_is_legal
 * and the path parameterization checks in joinpath.c.)  On the other hand,
 * in join_clause_is_movable_to we are asking whether the clause could be
 * moved for some valid set of outer rels, so we don't have the benefit of
 * relying on prior checks for lateral-reference validity.
 *
 * Note: if this returns true, it means that the clause could be moved to
 * this join relation, but that doesn't mean that this is the lowest join
 * it could be moved to.  Caller may need to make additional calls to verify
 * that this doesn't succeed on either of the inputs of a proposed join.
 *
 * Note: get_joinrel_parampathinfo depends on the fact that if
 * current_and_outer is NULL, this function will always return false
 * (since one or the other of the first two tests must fail).
